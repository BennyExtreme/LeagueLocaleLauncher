# Usage guide

* (1) Make sure you have the latest release from https://github.com/CollinMcKinney-jabukufo/LeagueLocaleLauncher/releases ***THIS IS A DIFFERENT LINK THAN THE GREEN CLONE/DOWNLOAD BUTTON***


* (2) Start **LeagueLocaleLauncher.exe**, choose the language/region you wish to use and then click the launch button. The tool should close and then League Of Legends should be launched using the language and region you selected. If that worked, then congratulations, you're done :D


* (3) If something isn't working right:
  * (a) Go to **config.yaml** which should be located next to your .exe (it won't exist until you run the launcher the first time).
  * (b) Change **LeagueClientSettingsPath** and **LeagueClientPath** to match the file paths in your League Of Legends install.
  * (c) Repeat step 2.
  * (d) If it still doesn't work, either leave an issue here on GitHub, or [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/713264229427445770?color=Blue&label=Join%20Us%20On%20Discord&style=plastic)](https://discord.gg/vA4w7rn) and we'll be glad to help you.
